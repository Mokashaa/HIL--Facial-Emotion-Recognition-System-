# ResNet18 Model

### This model was run by: 
- Mohamed Okasha

### Brief Description:
- Trained MiniXception model on FER2013 dataset for 60 epochs.
- Reached a training accuracy of 59.88% and a validation accuracy of 59.46%. with 7 classes 
- Reached a training accuracy of 65.61% and a validation accuracy of 66.33%. with 4 classes 



### Conculsion:
- training ResNets requires many epochs as ResNet18 have +14million parameters, transfer learning would be more efficient.
- Fer2013 isn't the best dataset to be used with ResNets as ResNets requires 3 channels input.
